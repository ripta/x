## The JIT Calculator Challenge

Outlined here: https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-jit-calculator-challenge/

Developed for AArch64, tested on macOS on an M3 machine:

```
❯ uname -a
Darwin Riptas-French-Toast-Pro.local 23.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Mon Jul 29 21:14:46 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6031 arm64

❯ rustc --version
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)
```

To run, just `cargo run` from this directory. Maybe a blog post coming soon?

Architecture docs available on their site. There's a "downloads" section on the
left-hand side with a PDF version of the entire site:
